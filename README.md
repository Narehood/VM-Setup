# VM-Setup
Installs general packages for XCP-NG VMs
(Very basic script)

Hacktoberfest 2024:

This is a very basic script I use when installing a few initial tools for my XCP-NG virtual machines. If you have any improvements such as switching the script to be able to identify Debian and Ubuntu as different, or any other additions feel free to contribute during Hacktoberfest 2024.
